What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Why should you have different branches?
In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

Answers: 
1) gitignore file is a text file that contains the which files and folders are to be ignored while comiting a project. Example of a gitignore file for java 
*.class
*.jar
*.war
*.ear
*.iws
2) Fast forward works in cases where there is a direct path from source branch to the target branch. It moves the pointer frpm sourch branch to the target branch's pointer without creation of an extra merge commit.
3) Branching allows user to work independently. The developer can branch out from the main code and isolate from the work done by others. 
4) There can be multiple repositaries based on the size of the project. But there can be only one repositary named with origin.
